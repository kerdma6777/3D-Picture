This is one version of the code that the Marriotts Ridge High School Team submitted to the 2015 [Zero Robotics](http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/) High School Tournament.  While it is not the final version (I can't give away all of our secrets!), it's a recent enough version to showcase the fundamentals.  This code is uploaded and run on SPHERES (mini-satellites).  

The ultimate goal of the competition is to score more points than your competitor.  Points are scored by taking pictures of points of interest on the central asteroid.  There are other factors that impact scoring (how close the satellite is to asteroid, solar flares, fuel, ect.), but the basis is picture-taking.  If you're interested in the specifics, see the [game manual](http://static.zerorobotics.mit.edu/docs/hs/CoronaSPHERES_Manual_v3.0.pdf).

In this [example](http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/ide/simulation/574076/), our code is uploaded to the blue SPHERE.  The comet is the central gray sphere and the green dots are the points of interest.  I recommend changing the viewing speed to 10x.  


This code is written in C++, utilizes the [Zero Robotics API](http://static.zerorobotics.mit.edu/docs/tutorials/ZR_user_API.pdf), and is compiled and executed by the Zero Robotics IDE.
